# 4Digit7Seg12Pin (STF\_A\_4) (WIP)

## What is 4Digit7Seg12Pin?
It is a Arduino library used to drive a basic 4-digit display like 5461.  
If you are lack of pins, you can try to use 4-digit display with chips like 595.  

## Usage
SORRY, STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.  

## About the name of variables and functions in this project
What's more, the name of variables and functions follows the rule of [FTN](http://www.github.com/KuangLei/FTN).
